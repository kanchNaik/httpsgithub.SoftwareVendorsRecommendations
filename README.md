Vendor Qualification System
1. Approach

The vendor qualification system identifies top vendors that align with a userâ€™s software requirements. The approach is divided into several key steps:

#Data Loading: The system loads a CSV file containing vendor information including product name, seller, rating, features, and main category.

#Text Preprocessing: All text data is converted to lowercase, special characters are removed, and the text is tokenized. Stopwords are removed, and both lemmatization and stemming are applied to standardize the terms.

#TF-IDF Vectorization: We use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert the cleaned text into numerical vectors. Importantly, vectorization is done for each feature separately, rather than combining all text into one long document. This avoids the dilution of similarity scores, especially when long descriptions would otherwise dominate shorter but more relevant features.

Similarity Scoring: The input query (based on software category and required capabilities) is also processed and vectorized. Cosine similarity is calculated between the query and each feature to assess relevance.

Filtering and Ranking: Only vendors with a similarity score above a chosen threshold are considered. These are then ranked based on their average similarity score across features. The top 10 ranked vendors are returned as the most qualified options.
